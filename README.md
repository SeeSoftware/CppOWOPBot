# CppOWOPBot
A C++ bot for https://ourworldofpixels.com/

*Note: this is a abandoned project and might not work anymore*

### Looks something like this (obviously not connected to owop)

### Features
* Non working Shape tool
* Image pasting tool
* Displaying contents of a terminal (cmd.exe)
* Displaying contents of a window (kinda like screenshare) with color reduction and dithering
* Unfinished lua editor for running scripts
* Almost limitless concurrent bot connections
* Proxy list management and usage
* Other stuff i didnt mention

### Missing features
* Interactive/Automated Captcha support (probably biggest reason of abandonment)
* Chaning of connection URL
* Polish

### Building
*(currently Windows only because of OS dependent stuff in the displaying of terminal and screenshare)*

1. Get dependencies for SFML, websocketpp, sol and others i didnt bother checking (i recomend using vcpkg)
2. Open project file
3. If you didnt use vcpkg add dependencies
4. Click build
5. Profit?
